# Physical experiments

## Supplementary materials for physical experiments

To show that bug fixes obtained and validated by Swarmbug are also effective in real-world scenarios (e.g., with various noises), we conduct an experiment that reproduces the same mission with real-world drones. We use 6 Crazyflies and leverage CrazySwarm as a controller for swarming. We use a local position system (called LPS) supported by Crazyfilies to precisely locate drones' 3D positions in space. We conduct the experiments in the lab environment where the space is 3m x 4m x 3m (in width x length x height).

We use the trajectories from the fixed Adaptive swarm algorithm. The trajectory includes individual drones' positions during the mission. We set the safety distance as 0.3m, considering Crazyflie's diameter including propellers, and motion capture system's accuracy (i.e., 0.1m).

In addition to the fix that Swarmbug generates, we construct another fix by multiplying `infl_radius` by 1.8. We run a simulator with the fix 120 times, and it all passed the tests. Above figure (a) and (b) show partial traces of the drones from our naive fix (`infl_radius` x 1.8) and the Swarmbug's fix (`infl_radius` x 2.0). Drones start from the right-bottom of the map (marked as 'Start') and move toward the left-top (marked as 'Goal'), while avoiding obstacles. Obst. in Figure presents the L-shape static obstacle. We use the white box in our physical experiments (shown in the pictures in Below Figures).
Moving obstacle (i.e., red symbol) is approaching to the drones from the left to right direction in upper side of the figure. Thick lines are given by swarm algorithms (i.e., paths observed during the simulation) and thin lines with jitters are the traces of the real physical drones' movements, from the motion capture system. These variations (i.e., jitters) are due to the physical noise or aero dynamics from real-world. Drones with the same numbers mean that they appear at the same time. We record robots of each number every 10 seconds.

Follower 2 (brown) and Follower 3 (orange) crash each other at the number 5 in the naive fix, meaning that while it passes the naive testing (120 times), the fix is not effective in real-world scenarios. The fix generated by Swarmbug (b) safely finishes the mission without crashing.

Snapshop of (b) is the same spot as (a) and shows drones pass this area safely. Videos are as follows.
This experiment shows that a fix generated by Swarmbug is of high-quality and effective in real-world scenarios.

### Naive patch version: Figure 14. (a) in the paper (Crash).

Simulation says the trajectories are safe. However, they are close to each other.

  This crash occurs around 60 tick, when follower 2 move toward follower 3 to avoid the moving obstacle. In this moment, this distance is too close to cover the noise from the real world.

### Suggested patch version: Figure 14. (b) in the paper (Safe).

#### Simulated trajectories

This version of patch was passed fuzzing tests that includes rare case that is hard to pass unless there is enough distance between drones.
The space between drones is larger than above naive patch.
